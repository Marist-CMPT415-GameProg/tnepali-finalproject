Welcome to my Final Project Repository!

This repository contains the game I've created Forest Frenzy Hide and Seek. 

The premise of this game is to hide in either different rooms or behind trees until multiple catchers come to find you! 

As a player, you start off as a hider, spawned in the heart of the forest. Your objective is to evade the seeker and survive for as long as possible without getting caught.
You can use various hiding spots such as trees, rocks, and abandoned houses scattered throughout the forest to conceal yourself from the seeker. Move cautiously and use your surroundings wisely to avoid detection. Keep an eye on the seeker's movements, as they will be actively searching for you.
But be careful! After 2 minutes, the seeker has a special ability to multiply, making the game even more challenging. You'll need to be extra sneaky and strategic to avoid multiple seekers hot on your trail.
To aid in your quest for survival, you may come across potions scattered across the forest that can make you temporarily invisible for a minute. Use them wisely to make a daring escape or outmaneuver the seeker.
The game continues until one of two outcomes: either the seeker catches you, ending the round, or you manage to survive until the time limit expires, resulting in a hider victory. Each round offers a thrilling, heart-pounding experience as you try to outwit and outmaneuver the seeker in the dense forest environment.
With its immersive gameplay, strategic hiding, seeker multiplication, and game-changing potions, "Forest Frenzy Hide and Seek" will keep you on the edge of your seat as you navigate the thrilling game of cat and mouse in the wilderness! Can you outsmart the seeker and survive the forest frenzy?
